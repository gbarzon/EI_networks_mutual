# Mutual Information in Excitatory-Inhibitory networks

Code for simulating the mutual information shared between the stochastic firing rate dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory populations and a time-varying external stimulus.
We estimate analytically the bounds on the mutual information in the limit of fast and slow input timescales.
